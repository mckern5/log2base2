data structures in java

intro
	ds and real life applications

arrays in data str
	INTR TO arryas
	arry vs ll

ll
	ll basics
	inserting a node at the beginning of a ll
	insertign a node at the end of ll
	deleting a node in ll
	searching a node in singly ll
	
	
doubly ll
	intr to doubly ll
	insert a node at the beginnning of doubly ll
	insert a node at the end of doubly ll
	seach a node in doubly linked list
	delete a nodes in a doubly linked list

circular ll
	circular ll basic
	inserting a node in a beginnning of circluary linked list
	inerted node in the end of circular ll
	seach a node in circular ll
	deleting a node in circular linked list

stack
	stack using array and applic
	stacking using ll

queue
	queue using arry and appl
	queue using ll

binary search tree
	binary tree 
	need for it
	bst basics and node creation
	binary recursion
	insrt a node in bst
	inorder traversal
	seach a node in bst
	delete a node in bst

graphs
	degree of vertex
	adj matrix rep of graph
	implementation of adj matrix
	adj list rep of graph
	implementation of adj list
	adj matrix vs adj list

binary heaps
	priority queue
	contruing binary heap=heapify
	delete max element in binary heap
